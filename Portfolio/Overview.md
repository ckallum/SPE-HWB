# Summary of Project

## Health and Wellbeing
This project is based around the university's sports system which is currently implemented as a website. The system allows members to book courts/classes, check their membership status, sign up to clubs etc.
Our aim (vision) is to create an app that will allow members to access these features through their mobile phones. The app may potentially feature a social media platform which will allow members to communicate with one another through messages, photos etc. The app may also feature a learning platform that will allows members to check workout routines through videos. We have decided to base the application on Android since it is open-source and free to use.
