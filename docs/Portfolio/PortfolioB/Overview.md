## Overview

**Client:** University of Bristol Sports, Exercise & Health department

Our project is aimed at helping the University of Bristol's Be:Active program by allowing students to have access to a phone app which will help them get more involved in sport activities at the University. The main goal of the app is to be an information point for students as well as a way for them to be able to view and save sports events happening at the university.

The client is the main source of sports at the university, being in charge of three main sports facilities as well as providing these facilities to different sports societies at the university. They are also responsible for running different events around the university, primarily with their Be:Active program being used to encourage more students to take part in sports.

The client's main motivation for having us develop this app was the fact that a lot of sports activities happen outside of the main sport building which makes it hard for them to keep track of attendance. Furthermore they want to further increase engagement in sports by having the phone app be a point of centralised information. It would make the accessing of information (such as timings of activities) be more user friendly due to the website being hard to navigate, especially on a mobile device.

Our aim is to create an app that will allow students to access these features through their mobile phones. Moreover, we want to make an app that students will want to use instead of just getting all their information about sports from other social media apps such as Facebook. The app may potentially include social media features which will allow members to communicate with each other as well as the ability to comment on posts or photos posted by students. The app may also feature a learning platform that will allow students to check workout routines through videos and pictures, encouraging more students to be active at the university.

We have decided to base the application on Android since it is open-source and free to use. Android is also easy to setup and compatible on a wide range of devices which would make the app accessible to a larger student population. The programming language we decided to use was Java due to the fact that all of our group members are already familiar with Java to some extent as well as Javaâ€™s compatibility with Android development.

At the end of our project we hope to make an app that will be a central point of information for sports at the University of Bristol, eventually releasing it to the public and allowing the students to use the app themselves.
