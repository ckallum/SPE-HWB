## Overview

**Client:** University of Bristol Sports, Exercise & Health department

Our project is aimed at helping the University of Bristol's Health and Wellbeing Department with goal of streamlining the users experience and ease of accessibility regarding events organised by the department via the creation of a mobile application. The app should act as an information point and a way to view, register and interact with such events.

The client/department is in charge of three main sports facilities as well as providing these facilities to societies at the university and the wider community. They are also responsible for running different events around the university, primarily with their Be:Active program being used to encourage more students to take part in sports

The problem the client has specified is that a lot of their organised events run in scenarios where there is no easy way for them to keep track of attendance and interest. Furthermore, there currently isn't a user-friendly/accessible way to find information regarding such events especially for mobile-users.

Our solution aims is to solve the clients problems thourgh creating an app that will allow students to access these features through their mobile phones. Hopefully, this increases the students engagements with these events by creating a user-friendly central point of information in contrast to students having to navigate Facebook for specific events.

Other potential features may include aspects of user-to-user interaction, commonly seen in conventional social media platforms, such as a comment section on events or an in-app messenger to find people to go to events with. The app may also feature a learning platform that will allow students to expand their knowledge about general, physical and mental wellbeing.

We have decided to base the application on Android since it is open-source and free to use. Android is also easy to setup and compatible on a wide range of devices which would make the app accessible to a larger student population. The programming language we decided to use was Java, as it is the standard for Android development.

We aim to eventually release the app to the public and allow students and the wider-population to have access to the app.
