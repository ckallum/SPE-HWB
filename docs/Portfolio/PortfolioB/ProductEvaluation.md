# Product Evaluation
## PLAN
- "surveyed" a group of bristol uni students who are members of the unis sports & non-members in order to make it fair
- asked at least 8 people of each group (member/non-member)
- evalulation took place in the indoor sports center (or any bristol uni sports facility)
- allowed people to test the app and give feedback
- provided a small questionnaire alongside the app in order to collate the feedback
- asked extra question's like "what features would you like to see in this app to make it more useable/efficient.." etc
- talk about the ease of UI, navigation etc.
- talk about whether they'd use the app on a daily basis??
- provide example answers/results of the questionnaire (using google forms or something)
- talk about how we took these results and improved our app
- maybe mention features we initially had in place but removed?
- since it is iterative dev, maybe we implemeted each part individually and tested each part on it's own?
- some features we didn't evaluation , so we deployed it
