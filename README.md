# Health-and-Wellbeing-SPE

This project is meant to be aimed at helping the Be:Active program by developing an app which will allow people to find out about events within the sports societies around the university. One of the main goals is to get more people interested and engaged in sports within the university as well as allowing them to log their personal activity rate. The app will also have social media type features such as like buttons to increase engagement.

The features we plan to have potentially include:

• GPS tracking similar to Strava

• Increase awareness on our programmes

• Prompts/nudges to support healthy activity choices

• Add like/comment features to make app more like a social media, increasing engagement

• Track participation numbers as well as feedback to get more indepth knowledge of potential improvements to programmes.

PLAN
===========


- Look at different technologies available to us and decide which will be best for our solution.

- Look over what the Be:Active program already offers, such as web functionalities.

- Read the possible app functionalities mentioned by client and see what can be realistically implemented.

- Look over similar style apps and see how they function.
