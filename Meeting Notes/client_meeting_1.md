## **Possible Project Functionalities**

- [X] ## Social Media/Event Promotion/Personal Improvement Platform and Application

  - **Incentive:**

    - All events and societies are currently accessed/organised through Facebook. This makes finding activities you might want to do difficult/inefficient. Currently very incorehent.
    - Some people don't want to use Facebook, don't want to register onto a platform for a single use of finding events.

    - We want a way to unite all of what the H&WB Department provides onto one coherent focused platform. i.e. an All-in-One application to view everything that is going on.

  - ### Possible App Functionalities:

    - **Provide incentives/rewards for participation in activities.**
